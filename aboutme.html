              My name is Hunter Saine. I'm an installation technician for AT&T.
              I started my career as an electrical apprentice with a regional
              heating and air company in North Georgia, and I worked my way up
              to Senior Electrician. After spending some time in this position,
              I decided to attend university with the goal of personal and
              professional development. I continued to work full-time while
              pursuing my education. Through a lot of hard work and
              determination, I was able to graduate from Kennesaw State
              University in 2022 with a B.S. in Political Science. After working
              for the same company for nine years, I decided it was time to
              search for new oppurtunities. I was excited when AT&T offered me a
              position. I'm currently pursuing a second degree in Computer
              Science at Oregon State University. I love working with new
              technologies, and I enjoy the challenges of solving complex
              problems. I'm learning HTML, CSS, and Javascript right now. I plan
              on learning Python next. When I'm not working, I love to travel. I
              have a passion for exploring different cultures, and I use my
              experiences abroad to help shape my understanding of the world. I
              believe that we should learn from the experiences of others, as
              well as our own, to develop and implement policies that would
              benefit us all. If you agree and would like to work together,
              contact me. I look forward to hearing from you.
