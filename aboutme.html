    <h1>About Me</h1>
    <p>
      My name is Hunter Saine. I'm an electrician for a regional heating and air
      company in North Georgia. I started my career as an electrical apprentice
      with my current company, and I worked my way up to Senior Electrician.
      After spending some time in this position, I decided to attend university
      with the goal of personal and professional development. I continued to
      work full-time while pursuing my education. Through a lot of hard work and
      determination, I was able to graduate from Kennesaw State University in
      2022 with a B.S. in Political Science. I'm currently pursuing a second
      degree in Computer Science at the University of North Georgia. I love
      working with new technologies, and I enjoy the challenges of solving
      complex problems. I'm learning HTML, CSS, and Javascript right now. I plan
      on learning Python next.

      When I'm not working, I love to travel. I have a passion for exploring
      different cultures, and I use my experiences abroad to help shape my
      understanding of the world. I believe that we should learn from the
      experiences of others, as well as our own, to develop and implement
      policies that would benefit us all. If you agree and would like to work
      together, contact me. I look forward to hearing from you.
